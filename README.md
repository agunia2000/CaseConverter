After running the application, you can see an empty **text area** and **eight buttons**.
Now, you can paste or type a text and change the size of letters using **blue** and **yellow buttons**.
You can choose from the following cases: **sentence case** (the option that capitalises the first letter of each sentence), **title case** (the option that capitalises the first letter of each word), **lower case** (the option that converts all the letters into small letters) and **upper case** (the option that converts all the letters into capital letters).
Additionally, you can clear the text area by clicking on the **Clear button**, paste text from or copy to the clipboard (using the **Paste button** or the **Copy button**) and download your text as .txt file (using the **Download button**).
